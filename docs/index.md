## Summary

_Weather or Not_ is an alarm clock designed for anyone who has to be somewhere on time. The alarm will adjust itself according to any traffic delays (caused by accidents, construction, or weather for example) to make sure you wake up with enough extra time to get where you're going by the time you need to be there.

## Intended users

* People who have longer work commutes.

    > As someone who commutes 1 hour each way for work, I don't always know when there will be construction or closures that will add an extra half hour or more to my drive. Waking up earlier when my commute will be longer would help me from being late or missing my important meetings in the morning.

* People who live in areas with erratic weather.

    > During the winter months, there's no telling if a storm that happens in the middle of the night is going to be a light dusting or plug the streets up with 2 feet of snow. If it's going to take extra time to get to school in the morning, I need to know so I can wake up with enough time to have a good breakfast before my exams.

* People planning long drives.

    > I have to drive upstate to have dinner with my in-laws tonight and need to be there by 7pm. I heard it was raining near where they are and need to know what time I should leave work so that I'm not late.

For each type of intended user, include at least 1 _user story_. A user story is usually just 1 simple sentence (no more than 2 sentences), in the voice of the intended user, stating a specific task that the user needs to perform, and the benefit that will be obtained. The simplest user stories take the form

> As a <type of intended user (_who_)> I want to <goal (_what_)> so that <benefit (_why_).

Please avoid writing too much for the user story. In particular, if the way the user story is written makes it difficult to see the _who_, _what_, and _why_, then you probably need to re-write it more directly. (On the other hand, a user story should not simply be a re-statement of the intended user description.)

Here is one (silly) example of an intended user, along with a user story. Please note not only the conceptual structure, but the Markdown syntax used.

* People who like to use randomness in their decision making.

    > As someone who enjoys randomness in my life, I need an app that lets me flip a virtual coin or roll one or more virtual dice, so that I can base my decisions on randomness, without having to carry coins or dice in my pockets.

## Functionality

List (using a bullet list&mdash;or ordered list, if order is relevant) the key functional aspects that will be provided by the app&mdash;i.e. tell us what the user will be able to do using the app. This should not simply be a re-statement of the [summary](#summary), but should instead provide a more specific articulation of the functionality and user experience.

## Persistent data

List, in general terms and using a bullet list, what content will be stored on the client side. This should include any information that users of your system would expect to be maintained (i.e. without connection to a server) across multiple sessions of use.

## Device/external services

If the client component will need to access special services of the device (e.g. sensors, contacts, messaging), list them here using a bullet list. Also, if the client component will need to access already-existing external services (e.g. real-time weather data, Open Movie Database, Open Trivia Database), those should also be listed here; any such references to external services should include links to the main page or API description page for the service.

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements

If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.
